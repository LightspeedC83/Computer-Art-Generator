# Computer Art Generator
This program generates art using Python's Tkinter module (all the output images at this point in time are screenshots). The main principle that drives this program is the ability to draw shapes on the coordinate plane using a distribution of points. The program randomly distributes points onto the coordinate plane and draws a shape by using points that are close together as vertices. The program can also take an image as input and use it to create a sort of ‘normal map’ that governs where the program is allowed to put the points that it uses to make the shapes. It is also possible for the program to use the color palette from the input image to control the color that it assigns to each shape drawn. In the future I may update the program so that it doesn't need to rely on the Tkinter module and can simply create a raster image as its output.
